\title{Bootstrap for parameters of models}
\usage{
coefbootstrap(object, nsim = 1000, size = floor(0.75 * nobs(object)),
  replace = FALSE, prob = NULL, parallel = FALSE, method = c("dsr",
  "cr"), ...)

\method{coefbootstrap}{lm}(object, nsim = 1000, size = floor(0.75 *
  nobs(object)), replace = FALSE, prob = NULL, parallel = FALSE,
  method = c("dsr", "cr"), ...)

\method{coefbootstrap}{alm}(object, nsim = 1000, size = floor(0.75 *
  nobs(object)), replace = FALSE, prob = NULL, parallel = FALSE,
  method = c("dsr", "cr"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The model estimated using either lm, or alm, or glm.}

\item{nsim}{Number of iterations (simulations) to run.}

\item{size}{A non-negative integer giving the number of items to choose (the sample size),
passed to \link[base]{sample} function in R. If not provided and model contains ARIMA
components, this value will be selected at random on each iteration. This is only used for
\code{method="cr"}.}

\item{replace}{Should sampling be with replacement? Also, passed to \link[base]{sample}
function in R. Only used in \code{method="cr"}.}

\item{prob}{A vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of the vector
being sampled. This is passed to the \link[base]{sample} as well. Only used with
\code{method="cr"}.}

\item{parallel}{Either a logical, specifying whether to do the calculations in parallel,
or the number, specifying the number of cores to use for the parallel calculation.}

\item{method}{Which bootstrap method to use. Currently two options are supported:
\code{"dsr"} - "Data Shape Replication, implemented in \link[greybox]{dsrboot};
\code{"cr"} - "Case Resampling", basic bootstrap that assumes that observations are
independent (not suitable for models with ARIMA elements).}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to the \link[greybox]{dsrboot} function.}
}
\value{
Class "bootstrap" is returned, which contains:
\itemize{
\item vcov - the covariance matrix of parameters;
\item coefficients - the matrix with the bootstrapped coefficients.
\item nsim - number of runs done;
\item size - the sample size used in the bootstrap;
\item replace - whether the sampling was done with replacement;
\item prob - a vector of probability weights used in the process;
\item parallel - whether the calculations were done in parallel;
\item model - the name of the model used (the name of the function);
\item timeElapsed - the time that was spend on the calculations.
}
}
\description{
The function does the bootstrap for parameters of models and returns covariance matrix
together with the original bootstrapped data.
}
\details{
The function applies the same model as in the provided object on a smaller sample in
order to get the estimates of parameters and capture the uncertainty about them. This is
a simple implementation of the case resampling, which assumes that the observations are
independent.

\examples{
# An example with ALM
ourModel <- alm(mpg~., mtcars, distribution="dlnorm", loss="HAM")
# A fast example with 10 iterations. Use at least 100 to get better results
coefbootstrap(ourModel, nsim=10)
